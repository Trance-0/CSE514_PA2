k-nearest neighbors has following weakness comparing to naive-bayes classifier because 
- it need to run with the data set, which required more storage than naive-bayes classifier
- it generally has longer training time.

Random forest has following weakness comparing to  decision-tree because 
- generally has longer training time.
- generally requires more storage required comparing to decision
