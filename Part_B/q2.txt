k-nearest neighbors is better than naive-bayes classifier because 
- it can be used to fit non linear relationships.
- it is easy to implement and interpret.

Random forest is better than decision-tree because 
- it uses ensemble learning by averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. 
- each of the tree is easy to explain.
