# Final report: Explain your methods and draw conclusions (40pts)

The data mining work is mostly complete, well done! Now, you need to communicate your results.
Remember that the goal of data mining is to obtain actionable knowledge, so your last task is to show
that your work has done just that.

* Introduction: Explain the motivation behind analyzing this dataset.
* Results: Use your best fit models to show relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable.
  * Why should these relationships be trusted?
  * What would you recommend be done, based on these relationships?
  * Include at least one figure to support your conclusions.
* Methods: Explain/justify your methods
  * Did you end up using standardized, normalized, or raw values for the predictor variables? Explain your choice
  * What values did you end up using for the gradient descent hyperparameters? Explain how you found those values
