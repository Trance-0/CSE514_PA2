The metric we choose is Recall (Sensitivity): Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly identified high-value customers) out of all actual high-value customers in the dataset. This metric is crucial for understanding how well the model can identify high-value customers. In real markets, we want to market those high-income customers with correct advertisements and it has a relatively low impact for wrongly classifying low-income as high-income customers. However, the marketing company can gain more revenue by pushing correct advertisements for high-income customers.
