We choose the third option

First we split up the income level by median in the sample data set (around 50000)

Then use the second option to split the population to three by maternal status:

In long-time relationship [Married, Together]
Not in long-time relationship [YOLO, Alone, Single]
Lost partner from long-time relationship [Divorced, Widow, Absurd]

We want to try to classify these population's income level based on other data provided.
